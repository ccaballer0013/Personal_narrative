# Personal_narrative# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description

In my animation, I showcase multiple different countries in which I hope to one day travel to. Each scene that includes images are categorized by a specific topic in which four images are shown and then filtered. In the 2D arrays, information about and representing each country is shown. 
## Image Filter Analysis

One filter that I applied was the colorize filter. This filter allowed only colors red, green, and blue to be shown on the image by obtaining each pixel's existing rgb and setting the color to whichever color it already had the most of. A new image filter that I created calculated if the amount of rgb was closer to 255 or 0. Depending on this information, each pixel was turned to either black or white when traversed.
